Across the country as liberated zones are erected at universities, faculty are showing up for their students-occupying alongside, getting arrested and using their positions within the university to protect their students. Gabi Starr and the Board of Trustees chose to arrest us instead of divesting from the israeli apartheid state. To condemn the use of riot gear and militarized police on Pomona's campus is to also condemn the IOF's militarized occupation and genocidal assault on Palestine. If you stand with us, you stand with divestment. We are asking for your support in our fight for divestment-with this resolution and beyond. Vote for divestment on May 2nd.\" [1-3]  \n",

As I am sure many of you know, last night Zionist counter protesters attacked the UCLA Palestine Solidarity Encampment by throwing fireworks, bricks, and mace into a peaceful crowd. UCLA and LAPD did nothing while counter protesters continued to attack students inside the encampment for hours. As a result, we now have heightened police presence on campus, and an ever growing number of students, faculty, and staff joining the current protests on campus demanding UCLA to divest and stop funding genocide. I  feel it is important to write to you all, and to encourage you to join the ongoing peaceful student protests for Palestine given that the entire reasoning behind them is to bring awareness to and end U.S. dollars and weapons being sent to support Israel. This is truly a historic time, and like the students we learned about earlier this week who protested the Vietnam war, we have a chance to make history. The reason I chose to teach this seminar on this particular topic is because  too few people are aware of the immense violent impact that US intervention has on global and national politics. We have seen in the past few weeks just how violent it can become, and how the US will continue to support its own interests above those of the people. I hope that you take the time to learn about what is and has been happening to Palestinian people for the past many decades. We are stronger together. Tomorrow I will be cancelling my office hours in solidarity with students in the encampment. I will be sure to make myself available to you all in the coming days if you have any questions or want to talk about what is going on. Please stay safe, Joelle\" [1]  \n",
      "12  SJP and UCSC Divest held a rally to launch their encampment, whose demands included an academic boycott of Israel, demanding the university \"[c]ut  ties UC wide with all zionist institutions--- including study abroad programs, fellowships, seminars, research collaborations, and universities. Cut ties with the Helen Diller foundation, Koret foundation, Israel institute, and Hillel International.\" The demands also stated,  \"We also see the necessity for escalated direct action in forwarding the struggle for a student intifada.\" At the rally, numerous chants called for intifada and the eradication of Israel. UC Faculty for Justice in Palestine (FJP) promoted SJP's demands, including an academic  boycott. Signs at the protest included: \"UCSC Professors Say فلسطین حرة  [Free Palestine]\", \"Professors 4 Palestine\", \"Long Live the Student Intifada\", \"Jews for Palestinian Liberation by Any [Includes Hamas upside down triangle] Means Necessary\", \"Jews for Intifada\", \"Generation  After Generation Until Total Liberation\", \"KKK, IDF, You're All the Same\", \"Free Palestine. Resistance Until Return and Liberation\" and \"Gaza Genocide Funded by U.S\". In addition, a sign taped to the door of a  university cafe bordering on the encampment read, \"[Iveta cafe] Closing Early So That Staff May Join the Protest.\" After the tents were erected, an additional sign appearing at the encampment stated,  \"Glory to Abu Obeida [Hamas Spokesperson] [upside down triangle symbol of Hamas]\", \"Death to 'Israelis'\" [upside down triangle symbol of Hamas]\", \"Greater Empires Have Fallen [with the \"A\" in \"Fallen\" the upside down triangle symbol of Hamas]\". Chants included: Intifada intifada, long live the student intifadaOne solution, revolutionThere is only one solution, intifada revolutionFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be freeFrom the river to the sea, we want total victoryIt is right to rebel, Israelism go to hellResistance is justified when people are occupiedNot another nickel not another dime, no more money for Israel’s crimesUC you can’t hide, you're supporting genocideUC regents you can’t hide, you’re committing genocide Joe Biden you can’t hide, you’re committing genocideGavin Newsom you can’t hide, you’re supporting genocideWe don’t want no two states, we want all of ’48Zionism cannot stand, free the people free the land[1-6]  \n",

By erecting this encampment, our students are fulfilling the most basic principles of a well-rounded and intellectually rigorous political education, the historical legacy of which UCSC cites in its own marketing materials as a point of pride for this campus... We, as educators in a public institution, committed to the imperative that public education must always serve the greater publice good, unconditionally support our students' organizing efforts and embrace our own obligation as faculty, staff, and instructors to condemn this scholasticide and the University of California's complicity in it... We, the UCSC chapter of the national network of Faculty for Justice in Palestine, also yearn for an immediate end to the genocide of Palestinians and the immediate restoration of Palestinian sovereignty and the right to return... We call for the UCSC administration to honor the demands of our brave and principled student body, and we pledge to stand with our students every step of the way. No state has the right to exist, but all people do. UCSC should take pride in the commitment our students are demonstrating to preserve the rights of Palestinians to live.\" [1]  \n",

Evergreen will not approve study abroad programs to regions where our students are denied entry based on their identity as Palestinians or Jews.\" The Memorandum further agreed to issue a statement to students stating, \"'Like many, I am horrified and grief-stricken by the violence and suffering being inflicted due to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I wish to see an end to the violence and restoration of international law, including respect for the  March 25 United Nations resolution. Specifically, the resolution called  for a lasting, sustainable ceasefire honored by all parties, immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, expanded humanitarian assistance, and the protection of civilians.

[1]  \n",
      "51    According to the student newspaper, The Black Explosion,  sponsored by the Nyumburu Cultural Center in the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, the SGA discussed and voted on a divestment bill, \"A Resolution Calling for the University to 'Divest from companies Engaged in Human Rights Violations',\" which failed in a 18-17 vote with one abstention. The bill's sponsor Abel Amene, an SGA Off-Campus Outlying Representative, said about the bill, \"We'll wait and this university will eventually be forced to divest... We will stop this genocide.\" At the meeting, Hershel Barnstein, president of Jewish Voice for Peace at UMD, argued the bill is not antisemitic and is instead trying to stop a genocide and claimed, \"Calling Israel the Jewish State is an insult to all of the thriving Jewish communities in the diaspora. Israel doesn't represent me and it certainly doesn't represent Judaism\". The resolution  was sponsored by numerous campus organizations including: Afghan Student Union, Anakbayan College Park, Anti-Imperialist Movement at UMD,  Amnesty International, Asian American Policy Union, Asian American Student Union, Egyptian Students Association, Latino Pre-Law Society, Mu  Delta Alpha Sorority, Inc. - Theta Chapter, Multiracial Biracial Student Association, Muslim Students’ Association, NOMAS (The National Organization of Minority Architecture Students), Jewish Voice for Peace,  Organization of Arab Students, Oromo Students Association, Pakistani Student Association, Political Latinxs United for Movement and Action in  Society, Prison Resistance Project, Somali Students Association, Students for Justice in Palestine, Terp CHRP (Committee On Human Rights in the Philippines), United Students Against Sweatshops, Young Democratic Socialists of America, and 17 for Peace and Justice.

We as Jews will not stop uplifting the voices of our allies. If our student government will not listen to us, we will vote them out.” [1]  \n",

The statement, titled, \"National Women's Studies Association releases statement about the violence in Gaza and Israel\" expressed, in part, \"The current escalation must be viewed in the context of decades of illegal Israeli military occupation and systemic violent campaigns... NWSA condemns the ongoing and persistent U.S. government’s support for Israel’s apartheid regime... As feminists, we recognize that violence and war often inflict gendered and sexualized harms on women and queer, trans and non-binary people... The struggle for Palestinian liberation and for a just and lasting peace in the region is intertwined with the liberation and resistance movements led by other indigenous, colonized, and oppressed peoples everywhere. Today, we reaffirm our unwavering support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) resolution, which NWSA passed in 2015... NWSA joins other humanitarian and human rights organizations in calls for an immediate ceasefire, an end to Israel’s current blockade of Gaza and the 16-year siege, and a prisoners’ exchange. We view these as necessary first steps, designed to prevent the loss of more lives and to lay the groundwork for comprehensive negotiations aimed at ending Israel’s apartheid regime and illegal occupation and recognizing Palestinians’ right to self-determination...
